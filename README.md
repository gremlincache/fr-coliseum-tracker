# fr-coliseum-tracker
Tool to let you see how many battles you've won and what loot you've gotten from the coliseum on Flight Rising. Doesn't scrape or provide any advantage, just displays the WS messages that can be found in devtools in a format that is easier to understand. Intended to be used with Tampermonkey
